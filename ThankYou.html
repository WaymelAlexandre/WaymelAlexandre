        <p>
            I’m using Hack The Box, the online security platform, to train my hacking skills. On the platform, I stay up to date with the latest attack paths and exploit techniques and practice my skills in a simulated real-world environment that uses up-to-date security vulnerabilities and misconfigurations. I regularly complete their virtual penetration testing lab to develop my understanding of penetration testing. 

-	See my Hack The Box profile here. 

I support my skills development by completing the labs on Try To Hack Me, on which I am currently ranked in the top 2%. 

-	See my Try To Hack Me profile here. 

I also have a understanding of:
-	Windows Privilege Escalation (Beginner)
-	Linux Privilege Escalation (Beginner)
-	Movement, pivoting and persistence (Beginner)
-	Practical Malware Analysis and Triage (Beginner)

            Coding
During my Certificate IV in IT, I learn to design and code programs using C# Python, and JavaScript. I can also design, build and implement data base systems and develop three-tiered applications accessible via hosting on cloud services. My skills include: 
•	C#, ASP.Net core
•	Angular, typescript, JSON
•	Object-oriented design, UML with Enterprise Architect
•	MS SQL-Server, T-SQL, Stored functions and procedures
•	Testing with XUnitxi Acceptance

Outside of my studies, I am learning Bash Scripting to expand my knowledge.

You can find my GitHub account here. And I’ve also set up a ssh key to ease the process of pushing code to GitHub.
